			<h1> ZIGGURAT </h1>
			<p> If you’ve got a taste for classic and contemporary designer labels, Ziggurat is the place to visit. 
				This effortlessly-cool secondhand outlet has been in the business of selling vintage pieces since the 1980s.
				Their clothes are pricier than at other shops, but the quality and timelessness of each garment makes the investment worth it. 
				Whilst many secondhand shops rely on the cheapness of the wares to lure in customers, it’s Ziggurat’s quality that draws in shoppers. <br>

			<h1> FERRY ANTIQUE CENTRE </h1>
			<p> The Ferry Antique Centre is as much an antique collector’s playground as it is a fashionista’s paradise. 
				Among its treasured pieces you’ll find art-deco style dresses, fine porcelains, ties and other things.
				And if you can’t find what you’re looking for, the Ferry Antique traders will actually go out of their way to source it – the shop even has a little black book 
				for keeping records of their customers’ requests. <br>

			<h1> WOT U WANT </h1>
			<p> This store has a bit of something for everyone here, with lots of kitchen appliances, furniture, art, clothing and collectables. 
				A whole bunch of Kiwiana and other antiques, lots of stuff to get nostalgic over, too. I’ve found a few beautiful 60s coats that 
				would have been shed from some hippies wafting through long ago. <br>

			<h1> THE ODDITY </h1>
			<p> Located in a dinky little town just out of Dunedin, a family run second-hand shop full of interesting things that make it feel like a 
				museum more than a shop. Old kitchenware, furniture, tins, vinyl, retro signs, quirky toys etc. Be sure to go up the creaky stairs at the back up in to 
				the attic for more treasures.<br>
				<b>ADDRESS:</b> 183 Main Road, Waikouaiti.</p>
